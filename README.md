# C-Programming Codes

Welcome to the C Code Samples Repository! This repository contains a collection of c code snippets, examples, and projects to help you learn and explore c programming concepts.

About
C is a general-purpose computer programming language used in the development of computer software and applications, system programming, games, web development, and more. ‘C’ is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning ‘C’ as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages.
